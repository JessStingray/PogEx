# PogEx

This was a simple AHK macro to cheese MOG EX in Nikke because farming gold was taking too long. Needs direct HW input to bypass the anticheat, which ended up being more hassle than it's worth.

Basically worked by manually getting to the final wave, then just running up, spamming the ult every so often, and clicking roughly where the upgrade window is to try and nab coins while hoping to run into a magnet occasionally. Certain stages like Mine I and Simulation Room I didn't stop the mook waves from dropping upgrade chips and gold, so you can get limitless gold that way. 

The downside of course being that the setup involves Movement Lvl 5 upgrade, so if you leave it running while you sleep, you have to hold down for 6 hours to get to the boss and kill it. 

I don't recommend running this, and it's honestly not much faster than just playing it and having a little fun while you farm the EX upgrades.
